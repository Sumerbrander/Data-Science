Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and active at the Vienna General Hospital. 
He identified the cause of childbed fever that caused the death of 10% of women who gave birth at the Vienna General Hospital.
He discovered that it was the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies.
In this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing.
